# General algorithms for numerical analysis

_Collection of algorithms in c ++ to perform numerical analysis_
## Starting 🚀

_You can clone the repository to start. All the algorithms are in a different folder_

See **List** to find one in particular.


### Requirements 📋

_To run any algorithm you only need the c ++ compiler that you prefer_


## Built with 🛠️

* [C++](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - Programming language used

## Contributions 🖇️

Please feel free to submit PR with any algorithm used for numerical analysis


## List
* Bisection Method - (bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions)
